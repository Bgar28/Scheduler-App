jQuery: Work Day Planner

This assignment challenged myself to refactor existing code of a daily calendar and give it the functionality of saving events for each hour of the day. The application is powered by HTML, CSS and jQuery. The user sees the current day displayed at the top of the page when the app is opened. The daily planner is displayed underneath with the time blocks color coded in relation to the current hour/past hours/future hours. The user is able to type an event into each timeblock and save each event to the local storage to refer to for future reference in case the page is refreshed.
